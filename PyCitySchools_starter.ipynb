    "  Average Math and Reading Scores reflect the overall academic performance in these subjects across different categories. Percent Passing Math and Reading indicate the proportion of students achieving a passing score, highlighting effectiveness in meeting educational standards. Overall Passing Rate combines math and reading passing rates to give a comprehensive view of overall student success.\n",
